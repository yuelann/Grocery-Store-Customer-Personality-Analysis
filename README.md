# Grocery-Store-Customer-Personality-Analysis

### Dataset ###
The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis), containing attributes about customer personality.

### Observations ###
Companies seeking their ideal consumer base can use common predictive variables across products, such as income, the number of kids and teens at home. These indicators help pinpoint potential ideal customers, offering insights for targeted marketing. For instance, a sweets seller may target a younger audience with higher incomes and no kids for optimal results.

Surprisingly, marital status was found to be insignificant in predicting the ideal customer, suggesting companies shouldn't focus on targeting consumers based on this factor. This analysis underscores the importance of customer segmentation, enabling more effective and efficient advertising campaigns. Tailoring ads to consumers more likely to make purchases enhances returns, saving time and resources.
